= Event API
:description: The Event API helps to interact with the singal system of the connected computer network itself.

**Lua Lib: `event`**

The Event API provides classes, functions and variables for interacting with the component network.

== Functions

=== `listen(Component)`

Adds the running lua context to the listen queue of the given component.

Parameters::
+
[cols="1,1,4a"]
|===
|Name |Type |Description

|Component
|Component
|The network component lua representation the computer should now listen to.
|===

=== `Object[] listening()`

Returns all signal senders this computer is listening to.

Return Values::
+
[cols="1,1,4a"]
|===
|Name |Type |Description

|Object[]
|Object[]
|An array containing instances to all sginal senders this computer is listening too.
|===

=== `ignore(Component...)`

Removes the running lua context from the listen queue of the given components.
Basically the opposite of listen.

Parameters::
+
[cols="1,1,4a"]
|===
|Name |Type |Description

|Component...
|Component...
|The network component lua representations the computer should stop listening to.
|===

=== `ignoreAll()`

Stops listening to any signal sender.
If afterwards there are still coming signals in, it might be the system itself or caching bug.

=== `clear()`

Clears every signal from the signal queue.

=== `string e, Component s, ... pull([number timeout])`

Waits for a signal in the queue. Blocks the execution until a signal got pushed to the signal queue, or the timeout is reached.

Returns directly if there is already a signal in the queue (the tick doesn't get yielded).

Parameters::
+
[cols="1,1,4a"]
|===
|Name |Type |Description

|timeout
|number
|The number of seconds that need to pass until pull unblocks when no signal got pushed.
 If not set, the function will block indefinitely until a signal gets pushed.
 If set to `0` (int), will not yield the tick and directly return with
 the signal data or nil if no signal was in the queue.
|===

Return Values::
+
[cols="1,1,4a"]
|===
|Name |Type |Description

|e
|string
|The name of the returned signal.

Nil when timeout got reached.

|s
|Component
|The component representation of the signal sender.

Not set when timeout got reached.

|...
|...
|The parameters passed to the signal.

Not set when timeout got reached.
